# Reinforcement Learning

## GitHub repository
This GitHub repository represents my learning attempt to learn this "beast" called reinforcement learning. We divide this Github repository into two parts. The first part is devoted to approximate the Q-function using neural networks using value-based methods. The second parts consist of finding an optimal policy in a continuous action-space using policy-based methods.
